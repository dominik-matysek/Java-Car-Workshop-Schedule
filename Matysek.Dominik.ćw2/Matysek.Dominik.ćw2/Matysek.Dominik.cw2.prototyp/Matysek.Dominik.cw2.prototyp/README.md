# Requirements #
1. full scope of the final version of the application from exercise 1,
2. adding a collection that is safe with regard to object types to the model class,
3. use of for-each loops
4. use of one of the following:
* enumerated type,
* own generic type,
* variable number of method parameters,
* own annotation (other than in the demonstration examples),
* lambda expression (with defined interface).
5. use of data stream processing in collections,
6. defining unit tests for all public methods included in the model (except constructors, accessors and mutators)
7. tests should cover correct, incorrect and borderline situations for each tested unit,
8. we do not test with limit values from the value range of simple types,
9. parameterization of all tests,
10. unit tests should be commented.
